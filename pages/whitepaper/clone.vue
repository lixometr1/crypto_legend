        <p>
          Each impulse character is unique in its own way and has its personal
          combat characteristics. Such a system creates a more flexible and fun
          interaction with the world. Through incubation, you can create more
          and more heroes in the game. The more clones, the more likely it is to
          create a unique member. Perhaps it will be you who will be lucky
          enough to create a clone with a predisposition to weapons or other
          characteristics necessary in battle.
