        <h2>Weapon</h2>
        <p>
          Your clones can own weapons that determine their class, adding the
          necessary parameters and bonuses to themselves during the battle. As
          you progress, you will receive weapons of a rarer segment and improve
          it. The weapon can be sold like any other NFT item in the Game Store.
