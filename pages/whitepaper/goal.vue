        <h2>What are Illuvials?</h2>
        <p>
          The planet’s core spills out a strange radiation that the beasts
          harness to grow, mutate, and unleash deadly attacks. Some Illuvials
          are easy to find, some are incredibly rare. They are found across a
          vast landscape. The radiation itself pulses in a non organic way that
          seems vaguely familiar. There are more than 100 Illuvials to find and
          collect throughout the world, each possessing unique abilities. They
          form symbiotic relationships with one another based on common
          affinities or classes, called Synergies. Using a Hybrid Synergy
          System, Illuvials are stronger when working as a team in the Battle
          Arena so make sure to collect synergising pairs to maximise your
          chance of victory. Different synergies create different bonuses for
          your team, allowing you to outplay your opponent—even if they have
          Illuvials with more raw power than you. Fusion allows you to merge
          multiple Illuvials of the same type into a more powerful beast, with
          different attributes, sometimes belonging to a completely different
          Class or Type. Remember that some Lines of Illuvials are very rare and
          hard to find, making their Fused form even more difficult to discover
