        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <p>
          At the very beginning there will be 6 main Hero Classes, these are:
          Defender, Warrior, Magician, Support, Assassin, Archer. Each of them
          has its own unique set of improvements and roles in battle. The
          well-known classics were specially left as a starting point for
          understanding the battles in the game. Perhaps, due to genetic
          manipulation, you will be able to develop new classes of Heroes and
          understand what their unique features and capabilities are. Be the
          first, who will know the secret and will be able to get rich on it.
