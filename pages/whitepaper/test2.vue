          Intro 222
        </h2>
        <p>
          You take the role of a survivor of a transport vessel in an
          intergalactic space fleet, investigating a perplexing distress beacon.
          When you finally reach the origin of the call, you discover a ruined
          planet, possibly the mythical cradle of your race’s civilization. A
          vast crystal ocean engulfs all but a tiny fraction of the planet.
          Extreme weather events assault the surface, giving way to strikingly
          varied climates. A burst of radiation disables the ship’s engines and
          you slam into the planet’s surface. Crawling free from the wreckage,
          you discover majestic beasts, some with near godlike power. Could this
          be what caused the downfall of this planet? Luckily, your race has
          begun to master the same energy that the Illuvials harness, and you
          are able to capture and control the deity-like fauna into slivers of
          crystal called Shards, mined from the planet’s surface. To uncover the
          mysteries of the planet, you become a Hunter, traveling across the
          land subduing and capturing Illuvials, and trying to unlock the
          Obelisks that keep most of the world closed off.

        <h2>What are Illuvials?</h2>
        <p>
          The planet’s core spills out a strange radiation that the beasts
          harness to grow, mutate, and unleash deadly attacks. Some Illuvials
          are easy to find, some are incredibly rare. They are found across a
          vast landscape. The radiation itself pulses in a non organic way that
          seems vaguely familiar. There are more than 100 Illuvials to find and
          collect throughout the world, each possessing unique abilities. They
          form symbiotic relationships with one another based on common
          affinities or classes, called Synergies. Using a Hybrid Synergy
          System, Illuvials are stronger when working as a team in the Battle
          Arena so make sure to collect synergising pairs to maximise your
          chance of victory. Different synergies create different bonuses for
          your team, allowing you to outplay your opponent—even if they have
          Illuvials with more raw power than you. Fusion allows you to merge
          multiple Illuvials of the same type into a more powerful beast, with
          different attributes, sometimes belonging to a completely different
          Class or Type. Remember that some Lines of Illuvials are very rare and
          hard to find, making their Fused form even more difficult to discover
