        <h2>Clans</h2>
        <p>
          By gathering in unity for the sake of one common goal, you can achieve
          success faster than alone. Enlist the support of your fellows to
          conquer the peaks that were previously not available. Being in a clan,
          you are not bound by any obligations and have the opportunity to play
          as before and receive bonuses at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clan quests and dungeons will be available to you in our game. This
          will accompany the strengthening of social relationships in the game,
          develop and establish new connections. Clan interaction will become
          your advantage throughout the whole game and will help you gain
          strength faster and give you the opportunity to fight for supremacy.
          In addition to external benefits, each member of the clan will feel
          their importance within the community, have the opportunity to help
          and receive valuable rewards.
