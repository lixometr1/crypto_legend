        <p>
          A marketplace for buying and selling NFTs will eventually be launched
          across all networks that have IMP deployed. At the first Impulse
          launch, the market is isolated in separate chains, there will be no
          opportunity to trade between them. After the integration of each
          personal chain is completed, the cross chain Impulse market will be
          launched, where every user can purchase NFT from any network to the
          one he needs. The main currencies are IMP and the currency of a
          specific market chain.

                    <li>
                        If necessary, indicate the duration of the listing. (If after the expiration of the validity period a suitable offer is not received, the listing will be automatically removed from the trading platform)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a seller cancels their listing before its expiration date, a transaction must be made
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>

                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You must complete a transaction purchasing an item—é</li>

            </ul>
        </p>

            At the initial launch of the IMP, the marketplace will be isolated and split across each chain. This means that buying and selling can only take place in a specific chain. In the long term perspective, a cross-chain marketplace will be launched. This marketplace will exclusively serve IMP assets, creating an integrated platform experience that delivers the lowest trading fees in the industry. The main currencies are IMP and the currency of a specific market chain. IMP holders in the future will be eligible for a discount on VIP commission in the universal cross-chain market. For NFT data retention contracts, chained techniques will be used to facilitate the transport layers needed to transfer data as the NFT moves along the chains.
