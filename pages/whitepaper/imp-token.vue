          IMP is a non-fungible ERC-20 / BEP-20 functional utility token. This
          token is a tradable asset and grants the owner the right to use it for
          trading or economic purposes. The purpose of introducing a native IMP
          token is to provide its own currency. This will enable users to play
          and participate in the gaming ecosystem. The IMP token can only be
          used in Impulse.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the help of the IMP, players will be able to create, buy and sell
          “non-fungible” in-game unique items. In addition, the IMP grants the
          right to use certain features. This creates economic motivation in the
          gaming ecosystem. As a result, each player will be rewarded for their
          efforts in a fair and transparent manner. Without creating personal
          token, participants will have no motivation to act for the benefit of
          the Impulse ecosystem and spend resources on participation. This
          creates a mutually beneficial environment between players, creators
          and investors, where everyone gets their own advantages. IMP tokens
          play an essential role in Impulse, allowing users to participate in a
          play-to-earn model, character upgrade, squad selection, and more.
          These tokens can be stored in exchange for value, traded, and bet for
          interest.
