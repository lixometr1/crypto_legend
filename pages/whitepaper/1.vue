        <h2>About project</h2>
        <p>
          Impulse is a collectible RPG game with full blockchain integration.
          Thanks to the blockchain of in-game items, the game grants
          participants the right to have in-game subjects through the ownership
          of the Non-Fungible Token (NFT).  Thanks to the captivating storyline,
          players can have fun and collect valuable items, as well as increase
          their value, playing alone or with other participants. Thanks to the
          blockchain, NFT owners will be able to auction on the Impulse NFT
          marketplace and other available platforms where the game has already
          been integrated. Our team is focused on cross-chain integration, where
          all impulse participants will be able to own tokens without the
          constraints and difficulties of one network.
          <br><br>
          To bring your vision to
          life, Impulse: Create an IMP token, a utility token for managing and
          developing the community economy Create NFT, direct game content that
          users can own Create the first version of the Impulse marketplace for
          trading within BSC Create interaction contracts for playing on the BSC
          network Connect Ethereum, Polygon, Solana and other networks to
          convert your tokens Add marketplace versions for the remaining
          networks as they connect Build a full-fledged DApp for direct selling
          between chains.
          <br><br>
          A community member is anyone who owns the IMP token, so
          they will always remain flexible and be able to redefine and rethink
          themselves. 
          <br><br>
          Impulse leverages blockchain technology using:
          Cryptocurrency for making payments NFT for in-game content ownership
          smart contracts for automation and decentralization between developer
          and community member tokenomics and decentralization for the
          governance and voting of the community and developers with the aim of
          improving the community, distribution. 
          <br><br>
          Our expectation is that the 4
          points above will provide transparent performance for Impulse and
          enable Impulse to generate fundraising that will support the team and
          community. In addition, all collected commissions at all sites will be
          sent to the treasury in a distributed form, part of which will be
          under the control of Impulse DAO. Thus, creating a motivational
          advantage for all IMP holders. 
          <br><br>
          Target IMP holders: Investor, CEO,
          Cryptocurrency Enthusiast, Collector, Economist, Video Gamer. 
          <br><br>
          You can
          join Impulse in fostering fair and transparent collaboration between
          the developers and the community in the cross-chain presentation of
          our product.

          Impulse is a virtual space, each character is minted as ERC-1155 with
          an address on the BSC blockchain. They can be traded, securitized and
          contain other ERC-721 like skins and accessories.

        <h3>Solana , BSC, ETH - NFT (CROSS-CHAIN TECHNOLOGIES )</h3>
        <p>
          Chains such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and Solana each
          have an increasing number of NFT platforms, here <a class="text-link" href="#wallet"> IMPULSE WALLET</a> stands
          out. IMPULSE WALLET allows NFT's to be minted, sold or traded across
          BSC, Solana, and Ethereum allowing users to bypass high gas fees while
          minting. This is achieved by wrapping individual NFT's in a ‘cloak' of
          the destination chain. These NFT's at any point can be unwrapped onto
          the original chain.

          A marketplace for buying and selling NFTs will eventually be launched
          across all networks that have IMP deployed. At the first Impulse
          launch, the market is isolated in separate chains, there will be no
          opportunity to trade between them. After the integration of each
          personal chain is completed, the cross chain Impulse market will be
          launched, where every user can purchase NFT from any network to the
          one he needs. The main currencies are IMP and the currency of a
          specific market chain.

                    <li>
                        If a seller cancels their listing before its expiration date, a transaction must be made

        </p>
        <p>
            At the initial launch of the IMP, the marketplace will be isolated and split across each chain. This means that buying and selling can only take place in a specific chain. In the long term perspective, a cross-chain marketplace will be launched. This marketplace will exclusively serve IMP assets, creating an integrated platform experience that delivers the lowest trading fees in the industry. The main currencies are IMP and the currency of a specific market chain. IMP holders in the future will be eligible for a discount on VIP commission in the universal cross-chain market. For NFT data retention contracts, chained techniques will be used to facilitate the transport layers needed to transfer data as the NFT moves along the chains.
