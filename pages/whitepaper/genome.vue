        <h2>Genome</h2>
        <p>
          The genome is the embodied legacy of the Heroes, a part of their
          strength and capabilities. Taking two genomes from different Heroes,
          people can breed new and stronger, capable and element- gifted heroes.
          There is still a very long way of selection before getting the
          strongest warriors.
