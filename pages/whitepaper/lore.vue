        <h2>Lore</h2>
        <p>
          Our world is under the auspices of the Greatest of the Lords, no one
          doubts in his value and even necessity for people. He has always been.
          And from time to time he can show his grace to the inhabitants of the
          planets. But on one good day, all planets of the system were attacked
          by unidentified creatures, from which the local self-defence forces
          couldn’t protect. Firstly, people didn’t understand that it was a
          global invasion and those who were not affected just ignored the calls
          to arms and mobilization. However, when it became obvious that a
          problem was global, it was already too late. There were a lot of
          invasion hotbeds and the human army was objectively losing. At this
          unfavorable moment, a savior appeared - God. He arrived along with a
          huge ship - the dam, on which the evacuation of all human beings was
          subsequently organized. Here God enlightened people about what is
          happening in the world and their role in it. The Lord told people that
          there are lots of inhabited worlds in endless space, that people were
          attacked by the creatures of all-consuming chaos etc. But God gave
          people hope for salvation from this attack - technology of other
          worlds. The central technique was the ability to clone warriors from
          other worlds, for which people were given genotypes and incubators.
          Humanity was assigned the role of generals, those who would lead the
          clone warriors into the battle. Since they don’t have time to reach
          life experience and to be an independent combat unit, people were told
          about the heroes of distant stars, introduced to their history and
          past, so people could better understand how and where they can come in
          handy. With the appearance of chaos in the people’ star system,
          elements came to their home planets. How and why? - no one understood.
          Although, perhaps, God knows, but who dares to ask him...However, he
          hinted that humans have a chance to master them and make them their
          main weapon.
