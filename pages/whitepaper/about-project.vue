        <p>
          Impulse is a collectible RPG game with full blockchain integration.
          Thanks to the blockchain of in-game items, the game grants
          participants the right to have in-game subjects through the ownership
          of the Non-Fungible Token (NFT). Thanks to the captivating storyline,
          players can have fun and collect valuable items, as well as increase
          their value, playing alone or with other participants. Thanks to the
          blockchain, NFT owners will be able to auction on the Impulse NFT
          marketplace and other available platforms where the game has already
          been integrated. Our team is focused on cross-chain integration, where
          all impulse participants will be able to own tokens without the
          constraints and difficulties of one network. To bring your vision to
          life, Impulse: Create an IMP token, a utility token for managing and
